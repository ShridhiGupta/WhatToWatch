# 🎬 WhatToWatch - Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommendation system built with Python. This project recommends movies based on textual similarity using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Recommend similar movies based on selected title
- Utilizes content-based filtering
- Clean and interactive user experience (Jupyter Notebook)
- Simple and beginner-friendly codebase

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset includes movie titles, overviews, keywords, genres, and cast.
- Preprocessed to extract meaningful content for similarity analysis.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLP (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)**
- **Cosine Similarity**

## 🛠 How it Works

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Vectorization of textual data
3. Calculation of similarity scores
4. Retrieval of top N similar movies

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShridhiGupta/WhatToWatch.git
cd WhatToWatch
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## 🧪 Run the Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Run the cells to see movie recommendations based on the input title.

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add collaborative filtering
* Build a simple web interface using Streamlit or Flask
* Include posters and trailers using TMDB API
